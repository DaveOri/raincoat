Python class to compute the polarimetric scattering properties of a series of
raindrop sizes according to specified parameters. The class acts as an interface
to the pytmatrix package which implements the T-Matrix method for single 
spheroids.

        sizes - array: vector of sizes of drops for which scattering proparties
                       have to be computed
        canting - scalar: if not None (default value) the scattering properties
                          are averaged over a gaussian distribution of pitch
                          angles with mean=0 and standard deviation [deg]

                            and by default it is set to 1.0 (spherical)
        elevation - scalar: elevation angle of the observing radar [deg].
                            90 (default value) means vertically pointing
                            and 0 means no elevation (horizontal scan).
